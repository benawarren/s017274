  - [FarmData2](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2): With a team of 2 other students, I helped develop the crop transplanting report webpage for FarmData2, an open-source software project that allows small organic farming operations to keep track of their plantings and harvests. 
  - [Shakespeare Analysis](https://github.com/s017274/ShakespeareAnalysis): Inspired by an assignment in a class on digital humanities, I've compiled code in Python and R that uses techniques like stylistic fingerprinting and unsupervised clustering to analyze questions of authorship and similarity in Shakespeare's works.
  - [Redlining Exploration](https://github.com/s017274/RedliningExploration): I wrote Python code to analyze the racialized elements of redlining in Philadelphia, using geopandas, pandas, and matplotlib.
  - [HOF Prediction](https://github.com/s017274/HOFPrediction): For an AI and Machine Learning class, I used multivariate linear regression techniques (implemented using scikit-learn in Python) to predict MLB Hall of Fame inductions from career statistics. Spoiler: games played has the most direct correlation to Hall of Fame induction!
  - [Collector](https://github.com/s017274/Collector) and [Topps Pack Opener](https://github.com/s017274/ToppsPackOpener): I implemented two (semi-complete) IOS apps for baseball collectors, using Swift's UIKit in XCode. 
  - [Cortex](https://github.com/Acemcshlaghg/Cortex): For an IOS developement course, I worked with a team of students to build an IOS app to efficiently match student tutors with tutees. I developed much of the calendar functionality: [Midterm Calendar](https://github.com/s017274/midtermCalendar).
